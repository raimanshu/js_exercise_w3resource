Write a JavaScript program to group the elements into two arrays, depending on the provided function's truthiness for
each element.

Use Array.prototype.reduce() to create an array of two arrays.
Use Array.prototype.push() to add elements for which fn returns true to the first array and elements for which fn returns false to the second one.

	// Method 2

	const partition = (arr, fn) =>
		arr.reduce(
			(acc, val, i, arr) => {
				acc[fn(val, i, arr) ? 0 : 1].push(val);
				return acc;
			},
			[[], []]
		);
	const users = [{ user: 'barney', age: 36, active: false }, { user: 'fred', age: 40, active: true }];
	partition(users, o => o.active);
	console.log(users);
