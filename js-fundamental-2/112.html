Write a JavaScript program to create a base-64 encoded ASCII string from a String object in which each character in the
string is treated as a byte of binary data.

Create a Buffer for the given string with binary encoding and use Buffer.toString('base64') to return the encoded string.

<script>

	// Method 2

	const btoa = str => new Buffer(str, 'binary').toString('base64');
	console.log(btoa('foobar'));


</script>
