Write a JavaScript program to determine if the current runtime environment is a browser so that front-end modules can
run on the server (Node) without throwing errors.

Use Array.prototype.includes() on the typeof values of both window and document (globals usually only available in a browser environment unless they were explicitly defined), which will return true if one of them is undefined.
typeof allows globals to be checked for existence without throwing a ReferenceError.
If both of them are not undefined, then the current environment is assumed to be a browser.

	console.log(isBrowser()); // true (browser)
	console.log(isBrowser()); // false (Node)
