Write a JavaScript program that takes a function as an argument, then makes the first argument the last.

Use argument destructuring and a closure with variadic arguments.
Splice the first argument, using the spread operator (...), to make it the last before applying the rest.

	const flip = fn => (first, ...rest) => fn(...rest, first);
	let a = { name: 'John Smith' };
	let b = {};
	const mergeFrom = flip(Object.assign);
	let mergePerson = mergeFrom.bind(null, a);
	mergePerson(b); // == b
	b = {};
	console.log(Object.assign(b, a)); // == b
