Write a JavaScript program to check if a given argument is a number.

Use typeof to check if a value is classified as a number primitive.
To safeguard against NaN, check if val === val (as NaN has a typeof equal to number and is the only value not equal to itself).

<script>

	const isNumber = val => typeof val === 'number';

	console.log(isNumber('1'));
	console.log(isNumber(1));
