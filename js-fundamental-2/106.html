Write a JavaScript program to check if two given numbers are approximately equal to each other.

Use Math.abs() to compare the absolute difference of the two values to epsilon.
Omit the third argument, epsilon, to use a default value of 0.001.

	const approximatelyEqual = (v1, v2, epsilon = 0.001) => Math.abs(v1 - v2) < epsilon;
	console.log(approximatelyEqual(Math.PI / 2.0, 1.5708));
