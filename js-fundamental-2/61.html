Write a JavaScript program to get a list of elements that exist in both arrays.

Create a Set from b, then use Array.prototype.filter() on a to only keep values contained in b.

<script>

    // Method 2 
    //#Source https://bit.ly/2neWfJ2 
    const intersection = (a, b) => {
        const s = new Set(b);
        return a.filter(x => s.has(x));
    };
    console.log(intersection([1, 2, 3], [4, 3, 2]));


</script>
