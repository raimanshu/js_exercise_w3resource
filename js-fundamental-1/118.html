<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to apply a function against an accumulator and each key in the object (from left to
    right).</h3>

    Use Object.keys() to iterate over each key in the object.
Use Array.prototype.reduce() to apply the specified function against the given accumulator.

    const transform = (obj, fn, acc) => Object.keys(obj).reduce((a, k) => fn(a, obj[k], k, obj), acc);
    console.log(transform(
        { a: 1, b: 2, c: 1 },
        (r, v, k) => {
            (r[v] || (r[v] = [])).push(k);
            return r;
        },
