<h3>
	Write a JavaScript program to get the symmetric difference between two given arrays.
</h3>

Create a new Set() from each array to get the unique values of each one.
Use Array.prototype.filter() on each of them to only keep values not contained in the other.

	// Method 2 
	//#Source https://bit.ly/2neWfJ2 
	const symmetricDifference = (a, b) => {
		const sA = new Set(a),
			sB = new Set(b);
		return [...a.filter(x => !sB.has(x)), ...b.filter(x => !sA.has(x))];
	};

	console.log(symmetricDifference([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 4]));

	// Method 3
	const symmetricDifference2 = (a, b) => [
  ...a.filter((x) => !b.includes(x)),
  ...b.filter((x) => !a.includes(x)),
];
