<h5>Points to remember</h5>
- read the code carefully<br>

<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to measure the time taken by a function to execute.
</h3>

Use Console.time() and Console.timeEnd() to measure the difference between the start and end times to determine how long the callback took to execute.

<script>

    // Method 2 
    const time_taken = callback => {
        const result = callback();
        return result;
    };
    console.log("Time taken: " + time_taken(() => Math.pow(2, 10)) + " ms");
    console.log("Time taken: " + time_taken(() => Math.sqrt(225)) + " ms");
    console.log("Time taken: " + time_taken(() => Math.sqrt((5 * 5) + (6 * 6))) + " ms");

    // Method 3
    // use performance.now

const t0 = performance.now();
doSomething();
const t1 = performance.now();
console.log(`Call to doSomething took ${t1 - t0} milliseconds.`);


</script>
