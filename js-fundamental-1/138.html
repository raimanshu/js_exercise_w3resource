<h5>Points to remember</h5>
- read the code carefully<br>

<h3>
	Write a JavaScript program that takes a variadic function and returns a closure that accepts an array of arguments
	to map to the inputs of the function.</h3>

	Note: Use closures and the spread operator (...) to map the array of arguments to the inputs of the function.

Use a closure and the spread operator (...) to map the array of arguments to the inputs of the function.
