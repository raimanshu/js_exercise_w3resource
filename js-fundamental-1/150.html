<h5>Points to remember</h5>
- read the code carefully<br>

<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to run a given array of promises in series.</h3>

    Use Array.prototype.reduce() to create a promise chain, where each promise returns the next promise when resolved.
<script>

    // Method 2 
    //#Source https://bit.ly/2neWfJ2 
    const runPromisesInSeries = ps => ps.reduce((p, next) => p.then(next), Promise.resolve());
    const delay = d => new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, d));

    // Executes each promise sequentially, taking a total of 3 seconds to complete

    runPromisesInSeries([() => delay(1000), () => delay(2000)]);


</script>
