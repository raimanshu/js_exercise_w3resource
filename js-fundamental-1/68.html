<h5>Points to remember</h5>
- read the code carefully<br>

<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program that accepts a converging function and a list of branching functions and returns a
    function that applies each branching function to the arguments and the results of the branching functions are passed
    as arguments to the converging function.
</h3>

    const converge = (converger, fns) => (...args) => converger(...fns.map(fn => fn.apply(null, args)));
    const average = converge((a, b) => a / b, [
        arr => arr.reduce((a, v) => a + v, 0),
        arr => arr.length
    ]);
    console.log(average([6, 7]));
    console.log(average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]));
