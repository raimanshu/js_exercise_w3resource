<h5>Points to remember</h5>
- read the code carefully<br>

<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to compute the new ratings between two or more opponents using the Elo rating system. It
    takes an array of pre-ratings and returns an array containing post-ratings. The array should be ordered from best
    performer to worst performer (winner -> loser).

/*
    For teams, each rating can adjusted based on own team's average rating vs.
    average rating of opposing team, with the score being added to their
    own individual rating by supplying it as the third argument.
