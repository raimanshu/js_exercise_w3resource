<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to nest a given flat array of objects linked to one another recursively.</h3>

    Note: Useful for nesting comments, such as the ones on reddit.com.

Use recursion.
Use Array.prototype.filter() to filter the items where the id matches the link.
Use Array.prototype.map() to map each item to a new object that has a children property which recursively nests the items based on which ones are children of the current item.
Omit the second argument, id, to default to null which indicates the object is not linked to another one (i.e. it is a top level object).
Omit the third argument, link, to use 'parent_id' as the default property which links the object to another one by its id.

    const nest = (items, id = null, link = 'parent_id') =>
        items
            .filter(item => item[link] === id)
            .map(item => ({ ...item, children: nest(items, item.id) }));
    // One top level comment
    const comments = [
        { id: 1, parent_id: null },
        { id: 2, parent_id: 1 },
        { id: 3, parent_id: 1 },
        { id: 4, parent_id: 2 },
        { id: 5, parent_id: 4 }
    ];
    const nestedComments = nest(comments);
    console.log(nestedComments);
