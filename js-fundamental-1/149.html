<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to get a random element from an array.</h3>

    Use Math.random() to generate a random number.
Multiply it by Array.prototype.length and round it off to the nearest whole number using Math.floor().
This method also works with strings.

    const sample = arr => arr[Math.floor(Math.random() * arr.length)];
    console.log(sample([3, 7, 9, 11]));
