<h5>Points to remember</h5>
- read the code carefully<br>

<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to split values into two groups according to a predicate function, which specifies which
    group an element in the input collection belongs to.</h3>

    If the predicate function returns a truthy value, the collection element belongs to the first group; otherwise, it belongs to the second group.

Use Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.push() to add elements to groups, based on the value returned by fn for each element.
If fn returns a truthy value for any element, add it to the first group, otherwise add it to the second group.
