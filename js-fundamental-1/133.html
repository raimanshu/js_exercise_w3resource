<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to get the symmetric difference between two given arrays, after applying the provided
    function to each array element of both.
  </h3>

  Create a new Set() from each array to get the unique values of each one after applying fn to them.
Use Array.prototype.filter() on each of them to only keep values not contained in the other.

      return [...a.filter(x => !sB.has(fn(x))), ...b.filter(x => !sA.has(fn(x)))];
    };
    console.log(symmetricDifferenceBy([2.1, 1.2], [2.3, 3.4], Math.floor));
