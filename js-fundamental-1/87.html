<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to get the n maximum elements from the provided array. If n is greater than or equal to
    the provided array's length, then return the original array(sorted in descending order).
</h3>

Use Array.prototype.sort() combined with the spread operator (...) to create a shallow clone of the array and sort it in descending order.
Use Array.prototype.slice() to get the specified number of elements.
Omit the second argument, n, to get a one-element array.
If n is greater than or equal to the provided array's length, then return the original array (sorted in descending order).

    const maxN = (arr, n = 1) => [...arr].sort((a, b) => b - a).slice(0, n);
    console.log(maxN([1, 2, 3]));
    console.log(maxN([1, 2, 3], 2));
