<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to find the most frequent word in a given string. Go to the editor
    Test Data :
    ("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog") -> "the"
    ("Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language.") -> "python"
    (" It was the same man, she was sure of it. It's always the same, Chauncey.") -> "was"
    (12321) -> "It must be a string."
