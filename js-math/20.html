Write a JavaScript program to evaluate binomial coefficients.
Note :
Binomial coefficient : According to Wikipedia - In mathematics, binomial coefficients are a family of positive integers
that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem. They are indexed by two nonnegative integers; the binomial
coefficient indexed by n and k. Under suitable circumstances the value of the coefficient is given by the expression :
binomial coefficients
Arranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of n, and in which k ranges from 0 to n, gives a
triangular array called Pascal's triangle.

Test Data :
console.log(binomial(8,3));
console.log(binomial(10,2));
Output :
56
45

	// Method 2 
	function binomial(n, k) {
		if ((typeof n !== 'number') || (typeof k !== 'number'))
			return false;
		var coeff = 1;
		for (var x = n - k + 1; x <= n; x++) coeff *= x;
		for (x = 1; x <= k; x++) coeff /= x;
		return coeff;
	}

	console.log(binomial(8, 3));
	console.log(binomial(10, 2));
