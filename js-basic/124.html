<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to create the value of NOR of two given booleans.
    Note: In boolean logic, logical nor or joint denial is a truth-functional operator which produces a result that is
    the negation of logical or. That is, a sentence of the form (p NOR q) is true precisely when neither p nor q is true
    - i.e. when both of p and q are false
    Sample Example:
    For x = true and y = false, the output should be logical_Nor(x, y) = false; For x = false and y = false, the output
    should be logical_Nor(x, y) = true.

<script>
  // Method 2
function test_logical_Nor(a, b) {
  return (!a && !b)
}
console.log(test_logical_Nor(true, false));
console.log(test_logical_Nor(false, false));
console.log(test_logical_Nor(true, true));

// Method 3 
!(a || b)
