<h3>
    Write a JavaScript program to sort a list of elements using Counting sort.
    According to Wikipedia "In computer science, counting sort is an algorithm for sorting a collection of objects
    according to keys that are small integers; that is, it is an integer sorting algorithm. It operates by counting the
    number of objects that have each distinct key value, and using arithmetic on those counts to determine the positions
    of each key value in the output sequence. Its running time is linear in the number of items and the difference
    between the maximum and minimum key values, so it is only suitable for direct use in situations where the variation
    in keys is not significantly greater than the number of items. However, it is often used as a subroutine in another
    sorting algorithm, radix sort, that can handle larger keys more efficiently".

    // Method 2 
    function gnomeSort(arr) {
        function moveBack(i) {
            for (; i > 0 && arr[i - 1] > arr[i]; i--) {
                var t = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[i - 1];
                arr[i - 1] = t;
            }
        }
        for (var i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i - 1] > arr[i]) moveBack(i);
        }
        return arr;
    }

    var arra = [3, 0, 2, 5, -1, 4, 1];
    console.log("Original Array Elements");
    console.log(arra);
    console.log("Sorted Array Elements");
    console.log(gnomeSort(arra));
