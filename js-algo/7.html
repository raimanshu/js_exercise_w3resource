<h3> Write a JavaScript program to sort a list of elements using Bubble sort
    According to Wikipedia "Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that
    repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in
    the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is
    sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the
    list. Although the algorithm is simple, it is too slow and impractical for most problems even when compared to
    insertion sort. It can be practical if the input is usually in sort order but may occasionally have some
    out-of-order elements nearly in position."</h3>
