<h5>Points to remember</h5>
- remember the logic of Math to get number between 1 to 10<br>

<h3>Write a JavaScript program to sort a list of elements using Cocktail shaker sort.
    Cocktail shaker sort (also known as bidirectional bubble sort, cocktail sort, shaker sort, ripple sort, shuffle
    sort, or shuttle sort ) is a variation of bubble sort that is both a stable sorting algorithm and a comparison sort.
    The algorithm differs from a bubble sort in that it sorts in both directions on each pass through the list. This
    sorting algorithm is only marginally more difficult to implement than a bubble sort, and solves the problem of
    turtles in bubble sorts. It provides only marginal performance improvements, and does not improve asymptotic
    performance; like the bubble sort, it is not of practical interest,, though it finds some use in education.</h3>
